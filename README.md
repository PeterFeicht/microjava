# microjava

Eclipse editor plugin for the MicroJava language, obsolete and preserved here for posterity.

This was created during a [compiler construction course](http://ssw.jku.at/Teaching/Lectures/UB/UE/2014/index.html)
at university, where we had to implement a parser for a limited subset of Java, called MicroJava.
I wanted to have syntax highlighting and error checking for the MicroJava example programs,
so I slapped together this beauty.
